# Dog vs Cat Image Classification Using SVM

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to classify images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). This is a binary classification problem where the SVM is trained to distinguish between two categories: cats and dogs. The project uses the Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, which contains labeled images for training and testing purposes.

### Key Objectives
1. Implement a robust and efficient pipeline for preprocessing image data.
2. Extract meaningful features from images to enable SVM classification.
3. Train an SVM model on the extracted features.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it for optimal results.
5. Deploy the model to classify unseen images accurately.

## Project Approach

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- **Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pushpakhinglaspure/cats-vs-dogs/data .The Kaggle Cats and Dogs dataset, containing thousands of labeled images.
- **Data Splitting**:
  - The dataset already comes with a predefined train-test split:
    - **Training Set**: 10,000 images each for cats and dogs (total: 20,000 images).
    - **Testing Set**: 2,500 images each for cats and dogs (total: 5,000 images).
  - This satisfies the 80% training and 20% testing ratio.
- **Labels**: Images are labeled as either `cat` or `dog`.

### 2. Image Preprocessing
Before training the SVM, the images must be preprocessed:
- **Resizing**: Standardize all images to a fixed size (e.g., 128x128 pixels) for uniformity.
- **Color Transformation**:
  - Convert images to grayscale to reduce dimensionality (optional).
  - Alternatively, use RGB channels for richer features.
- **Normalization**: Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1] to improve model performance.

### 3. Feature Extraction
Since SVMs work with tabular data, we need to convert images into numerical feature vectors:
- **Flattening**: Convert each image into a 1D vector of pixel values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Use feature extraction techniques such as:
  - **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for capturing edge patterns.
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction.

### 4. Training the SVM
- **Kernel Selection**: Use the RBF kernel or linear kernel depending on the data characteristics.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - `C`: Regularization parameter to balance margin size and misclassification.
  - `gamma`: Kernel coefficient for RBF kernel.
- **Training**: Use the training set to fit the SVM model on the extracted features.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset:
- **Metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualize true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives.

### 6. Model Optimization
- Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and feature extraction methods.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using grid search or random search.
- Test alternative kernels (e.g., polynomial) to improve performance.

### 7. Prediction on Unseen Images
- Prepare a few unseen images for testing.
- Preprocess these images and pass them through the trained model.
- Observe the classification results to verify the model's effectiveness.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **High Dimensionality of Images**: Addressed by resizing and feature extraction techniques like HOG and PCA.
- **Imbalanced Dataset**: Ensure balanced training by undersampling or oversampling techniques.
- **Overfitting**: Mitigated through cross-validation and regularization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of Support Vector Machines in image classification. By leveraging proper preprocessing, feature extraction, and model tuning, we aim to achieve an efficient and accurate classifier for the dog vs cat classification task. The approach and methodologies outlined can serve as a template for tackling other image classification problems using SVM.
